# Daniels

Daniels is a modern, responsive portfolio template built using Bootstrap 5 with a touch of JavaScript.
This project focuses on minimizing the use of custom CSS by relying heavily on Bootstrap's built-in classes and utilities.
Only minimal custom CSS is used for pseudo-elements, transitions, and some global styles that are either not covered by Bootstrap or better handled with custom code.

Key features include:

Responsive design using Bootstrap Grid

Smooth scroll behavior and active section highlighting with JavaScript

Minimal custom CSS

Clean and modern UI design

Scroll-to-top button and dynamic navbar behavior

## ðŸŽ¯ What I learned:

How to build a complete responsive layout using only Bootstrap 5

Improved understanding of Bootstrap utility classes and responsive breakpoints

JavaScript scroll events to dynamically update navigation and show/hide elements

Where and when to use custom CSS instead of relying on frameworks

Managing ::before and ::after pseudo-elements with limited custom styling

Applying smooth transitions and interactive behavior using minimal JS
